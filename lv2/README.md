# nectar/lv2 - Zig LV2 Bindings

High-quality bindings to the LV2 Standard.

Partially based off of [`zig-lv2`](https://github.com/ziglibs/zig-lv2) and [the Rust `lv2` crate](https://github.com/RustAudio/rust-lv2)

There's also plans for automagically generating Turtle metadata files, but it's not implemented yet.
